        I’m a 30-year-old aspiring Front-End Developer, balancing life as a
        parent to my energetic 2-year-old son. I thrive on creativity and find
        my inspiration in nature, whether it’s exploring the outdoors or drawing
        from the tranquility of natural surroundings. My passion for design and
        user-friendly digital experiences has led me to pursue a career in web
        development, and I’m set to graduate in May 2025. Currently, I’m seeking
        an internship from February 3rd, 2025, to May 23rd, 2025, where I can
        apply my skills and grow professionally. My journey into front-end
        development has been a rewarding blend of creativity and
        problem-solving, and I’m excited to contribute to projects that enhance
        user experiences.
